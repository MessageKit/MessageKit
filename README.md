# MessageKit

## Why?

UX is important-- but people often forget about Developer UX. MessageKit is a framework geared towards making a chat interface easy for both users and developers.

## What is it?

The project started when [JSQMessagesViewController](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQMessagesViewController) was deprecated. This project is still **in progress** and intended to be a complete overhaul of [JSQMessagesViewController](https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQMessagesViewController) written entirely in Swift.
